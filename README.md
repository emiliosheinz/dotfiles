# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles and scripts that I use to setup my devepment environment. I mainly use `bash` and [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.


## Usage

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emiliosheinz/dotfiles/main/init.sh)"
```
